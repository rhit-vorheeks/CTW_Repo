[Circle the Wagons],"Players 1,2,3 and 4 are on defense.
Players 5,6,7 and 8 are on offense.

The coach calls ""kick"" and the defensive players slide in anti clockwise direction, calling out the names of the offensive players as they pass them."
[Permanent Pivot Foot],"Have player receive a pass. Make sure player always lands on the same foot first when catching a pass, preferably their non-dominant foot, leaving their dominant foot free to attack. (What we call Stride Stop Left = left foot first for RH players, Stride Stop Right = right foot first for LH players). Repeat."
[4 on 3 Overload],"You start with three defenders and four offensive players.

The ball starts on the wing.


Instructions:
As the ball is passed, defenders have to leave their player, scramble to cover the ball or be in a good help position.

The ball can be skipped and players are allowed to dribble penetrate in their areas (but are mostly stationary early on as you learn rotation).

After you get the hang of rotating and scrambling, you go ""live"" and the offense looks to score."
[X Jump Shot],"Put a chair on each elbow with the seat facing mid court. Put a ball on each chair.
Player starts on the left block.

Player cuts through the middle of the chairs, around the right chair. Player scoops the ball and takes a jump shot.

Player then cuts directly to the right block.
Upon reaching the block, player executes step-through footwork, cuts through the chairs and around the left chair for jump shot.
If a re-bounder is available (2nd player, coach, etc.), he hustles after rebound and replaces it on the chair(s) and the shooter can go continuously.
Drill can be run for attempt or makes. If there is a re-bounder, it can also be run for time or for a progressive number of rotations (2 shots the first time, 4 shots the next time, 6 shots next, etc.)."
